          <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
          <p>
            The Eiffel Tower, known as "La Tour Eiffel" in French, is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world and a symbol of France. The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, the capital of France. Gustave Eiffel, a French engineer, designed the tower for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world when it was built, standing at 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antenna at the top. It held this title until 1930. Over the years, the Eiffel Tower has served various purposes, including as a wireless telegraph transmitter and a scientific laboratory. It narrowly avoided being dismantled after the 20-year lease for its land had expired, and it was saved in part due to its usefulness as a radio transmission tower

          <h2>KENROKUEN GARDEN</h2>
          <p>Kenrokuen is located in Kanazawa, Japan's main island. The name "Kenrokuen" literally means "Six Attributes Garden," which reflects the six essential characteristics of a perfect garden in Chinese philosophy. The six attributes (or principles) that the garden embodies are: spaciousness, seclusion, artifice, antiquity, waterways, and panoramas. Kenrokuen was originally created during the Edo period (1603-1868) by the ruling Maeda clan and it was opened to the public in 1871. Kenrokuen is known for its seasonal beauty. In spring, cherry blossoms (sakura) grace the garden, while autumn brings colorful foliage. The snow-covered landscape in winter is also a popular sight.</p>

          <h2>North Senitenel Island</h2>
          <p>It’s hard to imagine that in the 21st century, with so many people living on this planet, there could be any place left that’s unexplored or out of reach. As impossible as it may sound, it is not quite so. North Sentinel Island is considered to be the most dangerous island in India. It is located in the Bay of Bengal and is home to an indigenous tribe that has no contact with the outside world. The tribe is known to attack anyone who attempts to visit the island, and as a result, India has banned its citizens from visiting North Sentinel Island or attempting to make contact with the people who live there.</p>
